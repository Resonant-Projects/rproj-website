# Mastering Light: Adventures with Speed Lights and On-Camera Flash

It feels almost magical when you finally figure out how to shape light.
For years, I mostly used natural light or a basic on-camera flash,
which gave me decent results, but my photos often looked flat. Everything changed after I attended the
[FCCC 2025 Annual Conference](https://dpi-sig.org/Members/f3c25/mainpage.html),
where I had the chance to learn from the well-known photographer
Bobbi Lane, who many people call "The Mistress of Light."

## The Light Bulb Moment

"Light is the cornerstone of photography," Bobbi emphasized to our class. Over
Over the past forty years, she has sharpened her technical skills and
developed a creative style that really defines her work.
Her teaching goes beyond just technical skills. She focuses on
the importance of artistic interpretation and the power of storytelling
through photos.

One powerful lesson that stuck with me was when she instructed us to "Stop and
think about the 'essence' of your photo. Don't just do a snapshot. Take your
time. Think about what attracted you to want to shoot that subject/scene, and
explore what it means to you." This advice, though simple, completely changed my
whole perspective on using flash. I used to think of my speed light as just
a tool for dark scenes, not as the creative tool it really is.

Of course, once you start learning to use your gear well, you might notice
some gaps in your equipment. Luckily, this time it was something pretty
simple: just a set of reflectors and a wireless transmitter for my flash, so I
wouldn’t have to keep it attached to my camera.

## Dragging the Shutter: A Creative Dance

At first, I thought "dragging your shutter" was just about the effects you get with flash,
but it actually means using both your flash and the available light together to shape your photo.
delicate act of using both your flash and ambient light to craft your photo.

With numerous photos of fascinating subjects from the Venice Italy Carnival,
dragging the shutter became a creative technique, especially with examples showing how
using a shutter speed between 1/8 and 1/15 of a second can blur the background in an artistic way, turning what
might have been a plain background into a swirling scene that matches the fantasy feel of the
elaborate costumes.

As Bobbi shared with us, "I feel that we create a partnership with the subject
to make something that is not just beautiful but has a story that evokes the
magic and mystery of Carnival." While this quote specifically references her
working together with your subject is important for all types of portrait
working in tandem with your subject holds broad implications for all portrait
photography.

Even with her clear and detailed explanation of how to set up your camera for
using a flash, I’ve found that nothing beats real experience and time spent practicing.

## An Audio Engineer's Perspective on Light

After everything I learned that day, the best way I can explain it is
with an audio analogy. Not surprising, since I’m an audio engineer, but
hopefully this makes sense: learning to notice the details in how a subject is lit
is a lot like learning how movie sound is built from
music, dialogue, sound effects, and ambience.

Even with all the editing tools we have today, nothing beats capturing
the right light in your camera from the start. It’s just like using the right
microphone and getting the sound right from the beginning—it makes all
the difference! The better you get it in-camera, the less editing you’ll need
to do later.

## Understanding the "Big Three" of Light

Bobbi introduces what she calls the "big three" aspects of light: direction,
quality, and depth. The direction of light involves the placement of highlights
and shadows and the position of the light source relative to the subject, which
significantly influences the mood and the depiction of form. The quality of
light, whether hard or soft, diffused or bounced, affects both the mood and the
surface characteristics of the subject. Finally, the depth of light refers to
the darkness of the shadows.

By breaking light down into these basics, Bobbi gives a clear framework that
makes a tricky topic easier, helping photographers like me understand and
control light better.

The best part is, you can do all this with what you already have or by
spending less than $10 at a craft or hardware store for a foam board that’s
white on one side and black on the other.

## The Power of Fine-Tuning Your Light

One technique that immediately improved my outdoor portraits was Bobbi's
approach to adjusting light to match the story. She advises photographers to
"Fine tune your light to match the story of your subject, and don't settle until
you find it!" This reveals her belief that lighting choices should not be
arbitrary but rather should directly contribute to the narrative or message the
photographer intends to convey.

My wife probably won’t love me trying to juggle one more thing when we’re out
taking photos, but the incredible difference a simple reflector makes when
shooting in natural light is a game changer. When I see a photographer trying to
hold both a reflector and their camera, I can now understand their struggle and
will go lend a hand. It’s kind of like holding the door open for someone.

## Natural Light Mastery

Recognizing the accessibility and ubiquity of natural light, Bobbi also
dedicates instruction to its effective use through her "Natural Light Portraits
with Reflectors" class. She emphasizes that simply shooting in available light
does not equate to understanding it. Her teaching focuses on how to identify and
utilize various qualities of natural light, such as hard and soft light, bounced
light, window light, backlight, open shade, and even light from unexpected
sources like garage doors, to create flattering and dynamic portraits.

Whether you’re photographing flowers or people, it’s amazing how much the story
can change with just a change in lighting—from diffuse to spot, from above or
below. Always remember that taking away light can be just as powerful as adding it.

## The Art of Still Life and Product Photography

Outside of portrait photography, Bobbi's counterpart Lee Varis gave a
presentation on still-life photography, "Creative Still Life Photography". When
crafting a still-life photo, using a flash to specifically light certain parts
of an image allows you, in post-processing, to literally paint the light using
masks. This kind of work can take longer, but its surreal or hyper-real
The effect can be exactly what a product or art director wants.

These days, the tools make such a process a breeze. It just takes a few clicks
in Photoshop to use a paintbrush and make magic. A trick you'll have to learn
from Lee himself is how to use color channels to paint. You’ll feel like you’re
back in school, remembering which paint colors mix to make the
combination you envision.

## The Lifecycle of Flowers: A Pandemic Project

Photographing living things provides the opportunity to capture moments
throughout their entire lifecycle. Capturing the entire lifecycle of a flower is
not too difficult an endeavor, giving you an opportunity to use any number of
lighting techniques to help tell its story.

Bobbi told us about her pandemic passion project. When everything stood still,
flowers and nature were thriving, giving her a perfect muse and a way to keep
practicing photography. Her images showed how different lighting techniques
could transform the same subject throughout its life stages.

## Balancing Technique and Creativity

What resonated most with me was Bobbi's advice to "Learn a balance between
technique and concepts. An excellent photograph must have both to tell a story
that means something to the viewer." This shows her belief that technical
skill alone isn’t enough; a great photo also needs a strong idea or concept that connects with people.

As I continue exploring the capabilities of my speed light, I'm following
another piece of her wisdom: "Shoot as much as you possibly can and get
qualified feedback to help you grow. Practice and determination will get you
further than just sheer creativity."

## The Journey Continues

At the end of the day, learning to work with the light around you, whether you
control it or not, is a skill anyone can learn. I’ve been amazed at how
quickly I’ve started to notice lighting everywhere.

I'm quite jealous that I can't go to India myself!

Have you experimented with speed lights or on-camera flash techniques? I'd love
to hear about your experiences.
