# Environment Setup for Project Integrations

## Required Environment Variables

This document covers the environment variables needed for both Cloudinary integration and the Resources section powered by Notion.

### 1. Create Environment File

Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following variables:

```bash
# Cloudinary Configuration
# Required: Your Cloudinary cloud name (public)
PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name_here

# Optional: API key for upload functionality (public)
PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Optional: API secret for server-side operations (private)
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here

# Notion Configuration for Resources
# Required: Notion API token (private)
NOTION_TOKEN=your_notion_api_token_here

# Required: Notion database ID for resources (private)
NOTION_RR_RESOURCES_ID=your_notion_database_id_here
```

### 2. Getting Your Cloudinary Credentials

1. **Sign up for Cloudinary**
   - Go to [https://cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
   - Create a free account (includes generous free tier)

2. **Access Your Dashboard**
   - Go to [https://cloudinary.com/console](https://cloudinary.com/console)
   - Your credentials will be displayed on the dashboard

3. **Copy Your Credentials**
   - **Cloud Name**: This is your unique identifier (required)
   - **API Key**: Used for client-side operations (optional)
   - **API Secret**: Used for server-side operations (optional, keep private)

### 2.1. Getting Your Notion Credentials

1. **Create a Notion Integration**
   - Go to [https://www.notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
   - Click "New integration"
   - Give it a name (e.g., "Website Resources")
   - Select the workspace where your database is located
   - Click "Submit" and copy the "Internal Integration Token"

2. **Set Up Your Resources Database**
   - Create a new Notion database
   - Add the following properties (see [Resources Documentation](./resources-documentation.md) for details):
     - Name (Title)
     - Source (URL)
     - User Defined URL (URL)
     - Category (Multi-select)
     - Type (Multi-select)
     - Tags (Multi-select)
     - Keywords (Multi-select)
     - Status (Select)
     - Length (Select)
     - AI summary (Text)
     - Last Updated (Date)
     - Skill Level (Select)
     - Favorite (Checkbox)

3. **Share Database with Integration**
   - Open your database
   - Click "Share" in the top right
   - Click "Invite" and search for your integration name
   - Select your integration and give it access

4. **Get Database ID**
   - Copy the database URL from your browser
   - Extract the database ID (32-character string between the last `/` and `?`)
   - Example: `https://www.notion.so/workspace/DATABASE_ID?v=...`

### 3. Environment Variable Details

#### Required Variables

- **`PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`**: Your Cloudinary cloud name
  - This is required for basic image delivery
  - Must be prefixed with `PUBLIC_` to be available in client-side code
  - Example: `demo` (if your cloud name is "demo")

- **`NOTION_TOKEN`**: Your Notion API token
  - Required for accessing the Resources database
  - Keep this private (no `PUBLIC_` prefix)
  - Get this from your Notion integration settings

- **`NOTION_RR_RESOURCES_ID`**: Your Notion database ID for resources
  - Required for loading resources content
  - Keep this private (no `PUBLIC_` prefix)
  - Extract this from your Notion database URL

#### Optional Variables

- **`PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`**: Your API key
  - Required for upload functionality
  - Can be public (hence the `PUBLIC_` prefix)
  - Only needed if you plan to upload images from the frontend

- **`CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`**: Your API secret
  - Required for server-side operations and uploads
  - Keep this private (no `PUBLIC_` prefix)
  - Only needed for advanced server-side functionality

### 4. Deployment Setup

#### Vercel

```bash
# Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
vercel env add PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
vercel env add PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
vercel env add CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
vercel env add NOTION_TOKEN
vercel env add NOTION_RR_RESOURCES_ID
```

#### Netlify

```bash
# Add in Netlify dashboard under Site settings > Environment variables
PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name_here
PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
NOTION_TOKEN=your_notion_api_token_here
NOTION_RR_RESOURCES_ID=your_notion_database_id_here
```

#### Other Platforms

Add the environment variables through your hosting platform's dashboard or deployment configuration.

### 5. Validation

The integration includes automatic validation. If required variables are missing, you'll see helpful error messages:

```typescript
// This will throw an error if PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME is not set
import { validateCloudinaryConfig } from '~/utils/cloudinary';

const validation = validateCloudinaryConfig();
if (!validation.isValid) {
  console.error('Cloudinary configuration errors:', validation.errors);
}
```

### 6. Local Development

For local development:

1. Create `.env` file in project root
2. Add your Cloudinary credentials
3. Restart your development server
4. The integration will automatically use your credentials

For resources e2e/static-search reliability, refresh the Notion cache before running Playwright:

```bash
bun run resources:cache:refresh
```

The resources core-journey e2e suite is intentionally fail-fast when `src/content/resources-cache.json` is empty.

### 7. Security Notes

- **Never commit** your `.env` file to version control
- **Keep API secrets private** - don't use `PUBLIC_` prefix for secrets
- **Use different credentials** for development and production if needed
- **Regularly rotate** your API secrets for security

### 8. Troubleshooting

#### Images Not Loading

- Check that `PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` is set correctly
- Verify your cloud name matches your Cloudinary account
- Ensure environment variables are available in your deployment

#### Build Errors

- Make sure environment variables are set in your deployment platform
- Check that variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Verify no typos in variable names

#### Upload Issues

- Ensure `PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` and `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` are set
- Check that your API credentials have the necessary permissions
- Verify your Cloudinary account limits haven't been exceeded

#### Resources Not Loading

- Check that `NOTION_TOKEN` and `NOTION_RR_RESOURCES_ID` are set correctly
- Verify your Notion integration has access to the database
- Ensure the database has the correct properties (see Resources Documentation)
- Check that resources have "Up-to-Date" status to appear on the site

#### Notion API Issues

- Verify your integration token is valid and not expired
- Check that the database ID is correct (32-character string)
- Ensure your Notion integration has the necessary permissions
- Check Notion's API status page for any service issues

### 9. Free Tier Limits

Cloudinary's free tier includes:

- **25 GB** storage
- **25 GB** monthly bandwidth
- **1,000** transformations per month
- **1,000** images/videos

This is typically sufficient for most small to medium projects.
