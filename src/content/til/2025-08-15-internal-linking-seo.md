# Implementing an Internal Linking Strategy for SEO

Internal links are one of the most underrated SEO techniques. Today I implemented an automated internal linking strategy.

## Why Internal Links Matter

- Help search engines discover and understand your content structure
- Pass authority from high-ranking pages to newer content
- Keep users engaged longer by surfacing relevant content
- Establish topical relationships between pages

## The Implementation

```typescript
// src/lib/internal-linking.ts
const linkableTerms = [
  { term: 'Astro', url: '/blog/category/astro' },
  { term: 'web performance', url: '/services/performance' },
  // ... more terms
];

export function addInternalLinks(content: string): string {
  let result = content;
  
  for (const { term, url } of linkableTerms) {
    // Only link first occurrence, avoid over-optimization
    const regex = new RegExp(`\\b(${term})\\b(?![^<]*>)`, 'i');
    result = result.replace(regex, `<a href="${url}">$1</a>`);
  }
  
  return result;
}
```

## Content Readability Optimization

I also added a readability analysis to ensure content is accessible:

```typescript
export function analyzeReadability(text: string) {
  const sentences = text.split(/[.!?]+/);
  const avgWordsPerSentence = countWords(text) / sentences.length;
  
  return {
    score: calculateFleschScore(text),
    avgSentenceLength: avgWordsPerSentence,
    suggestions: getImprovementSuggestions(text),
  };
}
```

## Key Insight

Automation is key for consistency. Manually adding internal links across hundreds of pages is error-prone. A programmatic approach ensures every relevant term is linked, and adding a new linkable term instantly improves the entire site.
