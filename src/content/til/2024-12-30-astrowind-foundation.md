# Starting with AstroWind: The Foundation of Resonant Projects

Building a custom website from scratch is rewarding, but starting with a solid foundation can save weeks of work. Today I began customizing the AstroWind template for Resonant Projects.

## Why Start with a Template?

AstroWind provides:
- **Pre-built Astro components** with proper TypeScript types
- **Tailwind CSS integration** with dark mode support out of the box
- **SEO optimization** built into the layout components
- **Performance optimizations** like image optimization and lazy loading

## Initial Customization Steps

The first changes I made were to themes and colors, establishing the visual identity:

```typescript
// Customizing the color scheme
:root {
  --aw-color-primary: /* your brand color */;
  --aw-color-secondary: /* accent color */;
}
```

## Key Takeaway

Don't reinvent the wheel—but also don't be afraid to modify every aspect of a template. The goal is to use it as scaffolding, not a constraint. Within a few commits, the site was already distinctly "Resonant Projects" rather than generic AstroWind.
